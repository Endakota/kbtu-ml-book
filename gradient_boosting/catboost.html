<p>For more in-depth information and a comprehensive understanding of CatBoost capabilities, it is recommended to refer to the <a href="https://catboost.ai/en/docs/">official CatBoost documentation</a>. The original documentation includes extensive materials, usage examples, and detailed explanations of various aspects of the library.</p>
<p>CatBoost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting. Initially, it was introduced at Yandex for solving prediction, categorization, and recommendation tasks. CatBoost has built-in support for categorical variables and ensures high accuracy.
Main advantages of Catboost</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Superior quality when compared with other GBDT libraries on many datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>Best in class prediction speed.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for both numerical and categorical features.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast GPU and multi-GPU support for training out of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualization tools included.</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and reproducible distributed training with Apache Spark and CLI.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Then, on legal grounds, a series of questions arise:</p>

<h3>Operating Principle<a class="headerlink" href="#operating-principle" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<h3>Decision Tree</h3>
<p><a href = "https://fedmug.github.io/kbtu-ml-book/decision_trees/decision_tree.html">Decision trees information</a></p>
<p>The operating algorithm is as follows: for each document, there is a set of feature values, and there is a tree with conditions at its nodes. If the condition is met, the algorithm moves to the right child of the node; otherwise, it goes to the left. One needs to traverse the tree to a leaf according to the feature values for the document. The value of the leaf corresponds to the output for each document. That is the answer.</p>
<h3>Boosting</h3>
<p>Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique that aims to enhance the predictive performance of weak models by combining them into a strong ensemble. This iterative process involves training new models to correct the errors of the previous ones. For an in-depth exploration of gradient boosting, refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://fedmug.github.io/kbtu-ml-book/gradient_boosting/generic_gb.html">this article</a>.</p>
<h3>CatBoost is based on gradient boosting.</h3>
<p>Gradient boosting, a specific form of boosting, creates an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees, to build a predictive model step by step. It optimizes any differentiable loss function by minimizing its gradients.</p>
<p>Boosting is a method which builds a prediction model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{T}\)</span> as an ensemble of weak learners <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F^{T} = \sum\limits_{t=1}^{T} f^{t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In our case, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^{t}\)</span> is a decision tree. Trees are built sequentially and each next tree is built to approximate negative gradients <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{i}\)</span> of the loss function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span> at predictions of the current ensemble:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_{i} = -\frac{\partial L(a, y_{i})}{\partial a} \Bigr|_{a = F^{T-1}(x_{i})}\)</span>
Thus, it performs a gradient descent optimization of the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>. The quality of the gradient approximation is measured by a score function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Score(a, g) = S(a, g)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="important admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Question</p>
<p>How does CatBoost control the depth of decision trees, and why is this important?</p>
<div class="tip dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Answer</p>
<p>CatBoost uses “Ordered Boosting” and a “Symmetric Tree” structure to efficiently handle categorical features. It employs regularization for depth control, penalizing complex trees for better generalization. The algorithm adapts tree depth dynamically based on information gain, optimizing the use of the depth parameter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>How training is performed</h3>
<img alt="../_images/cat_is_boosting.png" src="../_images/cat_is_boosting.png" />
<p>The goal of training is to select the model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>, depending on a set of features <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span>, that best solves the given problem (regression, classification, or multiclassification) for any input object. This model is found by using a training dataset, which is a set of objects with known features and label values. Accuracy is checked on the validation dataset, which has data in the same format as in the training dataset, but it is only used for evaluating the quality of training (it is not used for training).</p>
<p>CatBoost is based on gradient boosted decision trees. During training, a set of decision trees is built consecutively. Each successive tree is built with reduced loss compared to the previous trees.</p>
<p>The number of trees is controlled by the starting parameters. To prevent overfitting, use the overfitting detector. When it is triggered, trees stop being built.</p>
<p>Building stages for a single tree:</p>

## Metrics

CatBoost supports a variety of metrics, such as:

<b>Regression</b>: MAE, MAPE, RMSE, SMAPE, etc.

<b>Classification</b>: Logloss, Precision, Recall, F1, CrossEntropy, BalancedAccuracy, etc.

<b>Multiclass Classification</b>: MultiClass, MultiClassOneVsAll, HammingLoss, F1, etc.

<b>Ranking</b>: NDCG, PrecisionAt, RecallAt, PFound, PairLogit, etc. --><div class="important admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Question</p>
<p>In a regression problem, explain when you would choose Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a metric in CatBoost.</p>
<div class="tip dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Answer</p>
<p>In scenarios where outliers can heavily impact predictions, MAE may be preferred over RMSE since MAE is less sensitive to extreme values.</p>

<h2>Catboost Classifier<a class="headerlink" href="#catboost-classifier" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
Training and applying models for the classification problems. Provides compatibility with the scikit-learn tools.
<p>The default optimized objective depends on various conditions:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Logloss</span></code> — The target has only two different values or the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">target_border</span></code> parameter is not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MultiClass</span></code> — The target has more than two different values and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">border_count</span></code> parameter is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.</p>
<h2>Loss functions</h2>
Note: for binary classification problems approxes are not equal to probabilities. Probabilities are calculated from approxes using sigmoid function.
<h3>1) LogLoss function</h3>
CatBoost uses the logarithmic loss function for optimizing class probabilities. The model aims to minimize logloss, which is important for accurate probabilistic predictions. Internally, CatBoost measures the error in probability prediction. Below we consider examples of user defined metrics for different types of tasks. We will use the following variables:
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( a \)</span> - approx value</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( p \)</span> - probability</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( t \)</span> - target</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( w \)</span> - weight</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( p = \frac{1}{1+e^{-a}} = \frac{e^a}{1+e^a} \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( L(w_i) = -w_i\cdot (t_i \cdot log(p_i) + (1-t_i)\cdot log(1-p_i))  \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( L(w) = \frac{\sum{L(w_i)}}{\sum{w_i}}  \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \frac{d(L(w_i))}{da_i} = w_i \cdot (t_i - p_i) \)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \frac{d^2(L(w_i))}{da_i^2} = - w_i \cdot p_i \cdot (1 - p_i) \)</span></p>
<h3>2) Multiclass function</h3>
CatBoost inherently supports multiclass classification. It automatically adapts its internal mechanisms for multiclass tasks.
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>For multiclassification problems approxes are not equal to probabilities. Usually approxes are transformed to probabilities using Softmax function.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{i,c} = \frac{e^{a_{i,c}}}{\sum_{j=1}^k{e^{a_{i,j}}}}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_{i,c}\)</span> - the probability that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> belongs to class <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> - number of classes</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_{i,j}\)</span> - approx for object <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> for class <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span></p>
<p>Let’s implement MultiClass objective that is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(MultiClass_i = w_i \cdot \log{p_{i,t_i}}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(MultiClass = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}Multiclass_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial(Multiclass_i)}{\partial{a_{i,c}}} = \begin{cases} 
w_i-\frac{w_i\cdot e^{a_{i,c}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{k}e^{a_{i,j}}}, &amp; \mbox{if } c = t_i \\ 
-\frac{w_i\cdot e^{a_{i,c}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{k}e^{a_{i,j}}}, &amp; \mbox{if } c \neq t_i 
\end{cases}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial^2(Multiclass_i)}{\partial{a_{i,c_1}}\partial{a_{i,c_2}}} = \begin{cases} 
\frac{w_i\cdot e^{2 \cdot a_{i,c_1}}}{(\sum_{j=1}^{k}e^{a_{i,j}})^2} - \frac{w_i \cdot e^{a_{i, c_1}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{k}e^{a_{i,j}}}, &amp; \mbox{if } c_1 = c_2 \\ 
\frac{w_i \cdot e^{a_{i,c_1}+a_{i,c_2}}}{(\sum_{j=1}^{k}e^{a_{i,j}})^2}, &amp; \mbox{if } c_1 \neq c_2 
\end{cases}\)</span></p>

<h3>Binary Classification<a class="headerlink" href="#binary-classification" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the realm of CatBoost, the raw function is a pivotal component that underlies the classification process, particularly in binary classification scenarios. This chapter aims to unravel the theory and significance of the raw function, offering readers insights into the inner workings of this fundamental element.</p>
<p>At its core, the raw function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> in CatBoost encapsulates the essence of a linear combination of input features and their corresponding model coefficients. For a binary classification task, the raw output for a given instance is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( z = \sum_{i=0}^n{\beta_i\cdot x^i}\)</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( z \)</span> is the raw output.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \beta_0,\beta_1,...,\beta_n \)</span> are the model coefficients or weights.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( x_1,x_2,...,x_n\)</span> are the input features of the instance.</p>
<p>This linear combination of features serves as the foundation for subsequent transformations, capturing the essence of the input’s contribution to the model.</p>
<h3>Sigmoid Transformation</h3>
<p>Following the computation of the raw output, the next step involves applying a sigmoid transformation. The sigmoid function, defined as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S(x) = \frac {1}{1 + e^{-x}}\)</span>, plays a pivotal role in mapping the raw output to a probability scale between 0 and 1. This transformation ensures that the model’s output aligns with a probabilistic interpretation, a crucial aspect in binary classification.</p>
<h3>Decision Threshold</h3>
<p>The transformed probability (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span>) is then subject to a decision threshold. In CatBoost and many other classifiers, the default threshold is often set at 0.5. If the probability estimate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P\)</span> exceeds or equals this threshold, the instance is classified as the positive class; otherwise, it assumes the negative class.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
In the analysis of the breast cancer dataset, we performed classification based on the target labels 'malignant' and 'benign'. We constructed a confusion matrix and juxtaposed the results with those obtained from <a href = "https://fedmug.github.io/kbtu-ml-book/linear_classification/log_reg.html">Logistic Regression</a>.
<p>Additionally, for the MNIST dataset, we leveraged CatBoost’s Multiclass loss function to classify digits. We created a confusion matrix, compared the outcomes with those from <a href = "https://fedmug.github.io/kbtu-ml-book/linear_classification/multi_log_reg.html">Multinomial Logistic Regression</a>, and presented the classification results.</p>
<p>These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the model performances across different datasets and highlight the utility of CatBoost in both binary and multiclass classification scenarios.</p>

<h2>Catboost regression<a class="headerlink" href="#catboost-regression" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>CatBoost Regression is based on the same gradient boosting algorithm as CatBoost Classifier. Gradient boosting is an ensemble method that combines predictions from multiple weak models (usually decision trees) to create a stronger model.</p>
<p>In regression tasks, CatBoost minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function. MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted values and actual values. The model aims to find optimal weights that minimize MSE.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Training and applying models</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A one-dimensional array of categorical columns indices (specified as integers) or names (specified as strings).</p>
<p>This array can contain both indices and names for different elements.</p>
<p>If any features in the cat_features parameter are specified as names instead of indices, feature names must be provided for the training dataset. Therefore, the type of the X parameter in the future calls of the fit function must be either catboost.Pool with defined feature names data or pandas.DataFrame with defined column names.</p>
<section id="popular-regression-models">
<h3>Popular regression models<a class="headerlink" href="#popular-regression-models" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<h3>RMSE</h3>
<p>For regression approxes don’t need any transformations. As an example of regression loss function and metric we take well-known RMSE which is defined by the following formulas:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{w_i * (t_i - a_i)^2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{w_i}}}\)</span></p>
<p>It is more convenient to calculate MSE derivative, we will use it instead of RMSE derivative. It will not affect the solution as these metrics have the same optimums.</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial(MSE)}{\partial a_i} = w_i * (t_i - a_i)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial^2(MSE)}{(\partial a_i)^2} = -w_i\)</span></p>
<h3>Poisson model</h3>
<p>Probability Mass Function of the Poisson distribution is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} (\lambda )^k}{k!}\)</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(k)\)</span> is probability of seeing k events during time unit given event rate (=number of events per time unit) <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>
<p>Event rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> as dependent variable
The idea of Poisson regression is to say that event rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> is a dependent variable.
The loss function maximizes the log-likelihood of a Poisson distribution.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L_{\text{poisson}} =  \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\lambda(X_i) - y_i \log (\lambda(X_i) )  \right)\)</span></p>

<p>How does adjusting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> impact the shape and characteristics of the distribution?</p>
<div class="tip dropdown admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Answer</p>
<p>Adjusting <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> influences both the shape and characteristics of the distribution. As <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> increases, the distribution shifts to the right, indicating a higher average rate of occurrence.
